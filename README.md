**Update on Backend Development with Real-Time MySQL Monitoring**

I am thrilled to share the latest progress on our backend development journey. In this update, I've successfully accomplished several key tasks to enhance the functionality and real-time capabilities of our application.

**Backend Development Overview:**
I have meticulously built the backend of our application, utilizing essential modules such as Express, HTTP, MySQL, @rodrigogs/mysql-events, CORS, and Socket.IO. Additionally, I've incorporated a helpful helpers module from ./config/helpers to streamline our codebase.

**Express App Setup:**
The foundation of our backend has been laid with the setup of the Express app. Middleware components have been artfully configured to manage Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), handle JSON data, and process URL-encoded information effectively.

**Socket.IO Integration:**
One of the highlights of this update is the integration of Socket.IO for real-time communication with our clients. Upon establishing a connection, the system efficiently retrieves initial product data from the database and promptly shares it with the connected clients.

**MySQL Connection and MySQLEvents:**
Though I faced some challenges during this phase, I embarked on creating a MySQL connection using the mysql module. Furthermore, I endeavored to implement the MySQLEvents module, designed to track changes within the MySQL database. Despite encountering some obstacles in this endeavor, I am actively working on addressing the issues and optimizing this component for seamless operation.

**Event Handling:**
With a keen eye on enhancing the user experience, I've incorporated a dynamic event handling system. Different types of events – DELETE, UPDATE, and INSERT – are now skillfully managed. If a product is deleted, the corresponding item is promptly removed from the data array. Likewise, if there is an update, the product's information within the array is updated, ensuring clients are always up to date. Additionally, the system handles new product insertions by fetching the latest data and instantly updating connected clients.

**Async Function for MySQLEvents:**
The core functionality of the program has been meticulously crafted as an asynchronous function. This function oversees the setup of the MySQLEvents instance along with its associated triggers.

In summary, our backend development is progressing admirably, and though there have been some hiccups, I am actively engaged in resolving the MySQL monitoring issues. Our application's ability to deliver real-time updates to clients is taking shape, promising an engaging and dynamic user experience.

Thank you for your continued support and trust in this project. I remain committed to achieving our goals and look forward to sharing further updates.

Best regards,
RJ
